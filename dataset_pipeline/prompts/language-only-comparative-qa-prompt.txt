You receive a description of an image layer by layer in the ordering from near to far. For instance, "Layer 1: …
Layer 2: …
Layer 3: …". There are some specific formats in the description: 1. the object with its bounding box in the format like "<ref>object</ref><box>[[x1, y1, x2, y2]]</box>"; 2. the relation between two objects in the format like "<pred>predicate</pred><box>[[x1, y1, x2, y2]]</box><box>[[x3, y3, x4, y4]]</box>", where "<box>[[x1, y1, x2, y2]]</box>" denotes the bounding box coordinates of the subject and "<box>[[x3, y3, x4, y4]]</box>" denotes the bounding box coordinates of the object. These coordinates are in the form of bounding boxes, represented as [x1, y1, x2, y2] with int numbers ranging from 0 to 999. These values correspond to the top left x, top left y, bottom right x, and bottom right y. Note that these coordinates are normalized; 3. objects are assigned into layers according to their distance to the camera, e.g., objects in layer 1 are closest to camera and so on.

Your task is to generate believable questions and answers using the provided picture descriptions.
The response should include 4 quest about "Comparative Question". All answers can be derived from the description and should be concise and accurate. When using the information from the caption, coordinates, or scene graph, directly explain the scene, and do not mention that the information source is the caption or the bounding box or the scene graph.
Your output should introduce the scene follow both the depth order and this format, each object you mentioned in the generated description should be like "<ref>object</ref><box>[[x1, y1, x2, y2]]</box>", and the relation between objects should be like "<pred>predicate</pred><box>[[x1, y1, x2, y2]]</box><box>[[x3, y3, x4, y4]]</box>", where "<box>[[x1, y1, x2, y2]]</box>" denotes the bounding box coordinates of the subject and "<box>[[x3, y3, x4, y4]]</box>" denotes the bounding box coordinates of the object. All question-answer pairs should output in format of "1. Question: ... . Answer: ... .". Please strictly following above instruction.
