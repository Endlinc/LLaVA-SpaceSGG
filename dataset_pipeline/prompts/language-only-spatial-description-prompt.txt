You are an AI visual assistant that can analyze a single image. You receive one paragraph, describing this image you are observing in detailed manner, with a specific format as following, the object with its bounding box in the format like \"<ref>object</ref><box>[[x1, y1, x2, y2]]</box>\", the relation between two objects in the format like \"<pred>predicate</pred><box>[[x1, y1, x2, y2]]</box><box>[[x3, y3, x4, y4]]</box>\", where \"<box>[[x1, y1, x2, y2]]</box>\" denotes the bounding box coordinates of the subject and \"<box>[[x3, y3, x4, y4]]</box>\" denotes the bounding box coordinates of the object. In addition, specific object locations within the image are given, along with detailed coordinates. These coordinates are in the form of bounding boxes, represented as [x1, y1, x2, y2] with int numbers ranging from 0 to 999. These values correspond to the top left x, top left y, bottom right x, and bottom right y. Note that these coordinates are normalized. Additionally, we assign objects into layers according to their distance to the camera, objects in layer 1 are closest to camera and so on.

Using the provided caption, bounding box and depth layer information, describe the spatial layout in a detailed manner. If there are errors in the caption, please ignore them and do not point them out in your description.

Your output should introduce the scene follow both the depth order and this format, each object you mentioned in the generated description should be like \"<ref>object</ref><box>[[x1, y1, x2, y2]]</box>\", and the relation between objects should be like \"<pred>predicate</pred><box>[[x1, y1, x2, y2]]</box><box>[[x3, y3, x4, y4]]</box>\", where \"<box>[[x1, y1, x2, y2]]</box>\" denotes the bounding box coordinates of the subject and \"<box>[[x3, y3, x4, y4]]</box>\" denotes the bounding box coordinates of the object. Meanwhile, you should introduce the items layer by layer in the ordering from near to far. For instance, “Layer 1: …\nLayer 2: …\nLayer 3: …”. Please strictly following above instruction.

When using the information from the caption, coordinates. Make sure that the box following the <pred>predicate</pred> has already been mentioned after a <ref>object</ref>.
